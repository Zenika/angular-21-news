💡 Angular 21 has just revolutionized forms.

👉 Signal Forms drastically reduce the complexity of Angular forms while improving readability, maintainability, and developer experience.

This now allows you to create, validate, and maintain forms in a simpler, clearer, and more robust way.

Our Full-stack consultant & trainer, Stéphane Francel, compared Signal Forms to Reactive Forms... and the results speak for themselves!

A few examples:
Reactive Forms: Observable-based API, Manual error message handling, No server-side error handling, ...
vs
Signal Forms: Modern API based on Angular's native signals, Built-in error messages, Structured server errors, ...

✨ Result: simplicity of the mental model and code elegance.
